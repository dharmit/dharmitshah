I am a software engineer working on [Go](https://go.dev) & [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and presently employed at [SUSE](https://suse.com) where I work on customer issues related to [Rancher](https://rancher.io). It's a role that bridges the technical support and product engineering teams. It means usually working on fixing bugs and less on developing new features.

Having worked on both sides of the bridge in the past, I'm curious to learn more about how customers use Rancher (and hence Kubernetes) as well as figure out which part of Kubernetes I want to focus on, i.e., is it custom controllers that excite me, or Kubernetes CLI, or the RBAC (very less chances), logging & monitoring, etc., the list can get really, really long! In the process, I might even end up wanting to get entirely rid of Kubernetes. :man_shrugging: :joy:

Outside of tech I prefer reading books (both fiction and non-fiction), nature walks, and writing (journaling and blogging). And, when life permits, some traveling!
