I work with [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) as a developer. I've worked in
different roles like System Admin, DevOps Engineer and Full Stack developer in
the past.

I write Python and enjoy working on tools like Ansible, Docker, OpenShift. I am
a organizer/co-organizer of few meetup groups:

- [Docker Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Ahmedabad/)
- [Ansible Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Ansible-Ahmedabad/)
- [Kubernetes Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Ahmedabad/)

When not fiddling with tech, I spend time reading
[books](http://goodreads.com/dharmit), clicking [random
pics](https://www.instagram.com/dh4rmit/) or taking a stroll in nature. And
this blog is an attempt at writing. :wink:
