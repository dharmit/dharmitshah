I am a Software Engineer from India. I code in [Go](https://golang.org). In the
past I have written software in [Python](https://python.org). Besides writing
code, I am passionate about writing documentation for the software.

I love reading books (no preference for genre as long as the book is
engrossing), watching travel shows, traveling (when pandemic is not busy
screwing things), and watching nature shows. I love learning new things about
technology, productivity, life-hacks, and everything that piques my interest.

I work with [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) as a Team Lead and Senior Softare
Engineer on the [odo project](https://github.com/openshift/odo). Previously,
I've worked with different companies in different roles like System Admin,
DevOps Engineer and Full Stack developer. I have been more of a "breadth"
person than "depth".

I enjoy containers, Kubernetes, vim, GoLand, zsh, markdown, Go, Python, mutt,
aliases, command line, Virtualization, and more!

I am the organizer/co-organizer of few meetup groups:

- [Kubernetes Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Ahmedabad/)
- [Docker Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Ahmedabad/)
- [Ansible Ahmedabad](https://www.meetup.com/Ansible-Ahmedabad/)

When not fiddling with tech, I spend time reading
[books](http://goodreads.com/dharmit), clicking [random
pics](https://www.instagram.com/dh4rmit/) or taking a stroll in nature. And
this blog is an attempt at writing. :wink:
