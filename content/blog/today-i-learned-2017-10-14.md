I have this habit of reading self-help/self-improvement and philosophical
articles across the Internet. Sometimes books as well. During my teenage,
whenever I visited a [Crossword bookstore](http://www.crossword.in/) in search
of some interesting fiction, I would chuckle at the pile of books in self-help
section. I used to think, "Who on Earth would be interested in reading such
books?" But, during my twenties, I don't know when I myself started reading
on various topics like positivity, morning routines, food habits, exercise,
productivity, reading more books, so on and so forth.

After reading a bit *too* much of these, I started seeing repeating content (or
advises) and eventually got bored of a few writers/sites. That's when I
unsubscribed from quite a few sites and limited myself to reading something
that seemed not completely repititive.

In **Today I learned**, I'm going to write in a few words about what I learned
from the articles I read in a particular week or on a Saturday morning! It is
either going to be a one off post or a series, hopefully latter, that I will
write on a weekend. Weekend because it's generally on a Saturday that I take in
somewhat heavy dose of self-help content. :wink:


### [The Art of Creating Purpose](https://www.designluck.com/creating-purpose/)

This article talks about pros and cons of short-term and long-term goal
setting. It talks about how long-term goals are vulnerable to a person's
changing perspectives over a period of time. And perspectives are bound to
change with experiences.

It argues that any point in our lives, there's a lot that we want so, a better
question to ask ourselves in order to create purpose would be, "Given my
current situation, what way of life do I not want?" That, in author's opinion,
gives a better understanding of things we want and are reasonable.

Truth is discomforting, and so is this statement in the blog:

> A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice
> made for him by circumstance.

One either makes a choice to float with the tide or swim for a goal. In either
case, we must make a decision for ourselves or, end up with whatever our
circumstances force upon us should we procrastinate.

Instead of molding ourselves to a long-term goal, it's better to continuously
redefine what it's like to be a better of version of you tomorrow than you are
today.


### [Tell Me What You Read, And Iâ€™ll Tell You Who You Are](https://medium.com/personal-growth/tell-me-what-you-read-and-ill-tell-you-who-you-are-dbbe9d250b2e)

I love reading. So, naturally, this title interested me. And it didn't
disappoint.

Author starts with a solid example of Elon Musk, whose illustrious career has
had a very strong link with his reading habits. In this age of information
overload, it's difficult to jot down on what truly is worth reading. I've been
practicing a few things listed in this article like, cutting down social media
usage, staying away from mainstream media where sensationalism is the
bestseller, and making reading a priority instead of something done to kill
time.

What we read is extremely important because knowingly or unknowingly, we're
reading a lot everyday. It's either in the form of a novel, blog, scrolling
through social media feed or simply browsing random stuff on the Internet.
Instead of passive reading, it should be something that we do actively and are
well aware of. This is because the information our minds receive through
reading will eventually shape up our perceptions about the world around us.
Read good, feel good; read sensational, negative stuff and feel grumpy.

Number of books being published every year have increased manifold in recent
past and it's expected to increase further! So, it's more important than ever
to zero down on what we decide to read and what we decide to let-go/ignore. It
will decide the quality of mind we develop.

### [The First Hour: Creating Powerful Mornings](https://zenhabits.net/first-hour/)

Leo Babauta's blog is one of the first places where I started reading
self-help/self-improvement. He's among my favorite writers. There was a brief time
during which I didn't find his writing interesting. I guess, even the best
people out there can have a bit of rough time.

I'm a morning person and never completely satisfied with how I spend my
mornings. This post is amazing in that it helped me accept imperfections and
take things one step at a time. I could finally accept that it's normal to have
a morning routine that changes over time. For me, seasons have an impact on my
mornings - what I'm able to do in the mornings during winter is not necessarily
doable in summer or monsoon. 

The first hour of the day is pretty important in setting the tone for the day.
I recently met a film director who prefers to stay quiet in the mornings and
enjoy nature's sounds around his place (he lives in a house surrounded by
trees). Leo's suggested some tasks that you can do during the first hour and
thus kickstart the day on the right note!

Most important takeaways from this blog are

- not to fix things in stone
- imperfections are normal
- there's variety of things one can do in the morning depending on one's liking

### That's it!

Well, I read more than three articles. But I'm not a fan of reading really long
posts. And hence, I don't want to write long ones either.

Until next time...
