Around the same time last year and till the middle of 2018, I wasn't so
addicted to social media. I still don't think of myself as someone addicted to
social media. For example, I'm very inactive on Facebook and Twitter. And I
don't understand why people even use Snapchat at all! Yes, I'm that dumb/old
school. But, I get addicted to people. And I am not sure which is worse.

### The Preface

I had been spending a lot of time on Instagram lately. Besides following some
motivational speakers, quotes pages, school-time crushes (truth is I always
have a crush on someone :wink:), I talked with a few people on the app. And few
of these are my favourite people! But it's not your usual chat app. And I don't
know what is with it that even when there are no notifications, I would open
up the app and mindlessly scroll through the feed.

While mindlessly scrolling without any notifications, I knew I was not making
the best use of the time but, I also started feeling like my friends were too
busy in their lives. At one point, I started feeling like they don't want me
around. I think I had a pretty bad anxiety situation that I had dragged myself
into. And things were getting worse for me with every passing day. I had to get
back to being sane again.

In the past, I have uninstalled Instagram a number of times because I started
observing the mindless scrolling behaviour. But with the advent of chat
feature, it became impossible to remove the app since it would mean cutting off
the communication with closest people.

### What did I do about it?

I wasn't feeling well last Saturday so I messaged a friend about it, took
medicines, had a chat with my wife and went to bed. I was in Europe (Brno and
Brussels) last month and along with bringing back a lot of chocolates for
family and friends, I had brought back a really bad flu as a personal souvenir
- especially for me!

Next morning, I and my wife were supposed to be travelling to a nearby town for
her work but I decided to stay back due to the flu & fever. Rest of that
Sunday, I didn't turn on the data on my phone since I wasn't feeling well.
Maybe it was flu getting into my head that I felt like staying offline on my
phone for some more time and I challenged myself to do so for a week. So, just
like that, without notifying anyone, I kept the data on my phone
off for an entire week.

### What was I hoping to achieve?

Well, quite a few hypothetical things actually. Here's a list:

- I was hoping to get a call from the people I thought were really close to me.
  Not many. Just 1 or 2 persons who I communicated with on a daily basis
  through Instagram and WhatsApp because I thought I was important to them.

- I was hoping to get my thoughts sorted. I am turning 30 in a couple of days
  and I feel like I have not accomplished anything that would make me feel
  proud. Like really proud!

- Writing is thinking. And I recently started doing it. I wanted to write more
  about what's going on in my head.

- Hours of boring time. At least 1-1.5 hours a day because that's how much I
  used to spend on Instagram. I hoped for some ideas to come up when my mind
  was busy being bored.

- Read more. I managed to read [10 books last
  year](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/7501-2018-reading-challenge) and
  have challenged myself to read 15 this year. Since I have not made any
  significant progress in the first two months of the year, I was hoping to
  make some during the quiet period.

### What did I really achieve or, how did the experiment really go?

- First off, the flu fucked me bad enough to take two days of sick leave from
  work. But it was a blessing in disguise. No internet on the phone, no work,
  not an ounce of energy to even take a shower - boredom unleashed (if cough
  let its leash loose.)

- No phone calls. Not from the few close people, not from anyone. But, to be
  fair to them, I went off without a warning. Just the way most people die.
  Isn't it very common to miss someone when they're dead? I'm not sure how much
  of time and effort it would take to simply check on someone you love. Not even
  5 minutes per person per day, I guess. Anyway, this was neither surprising nor
  disappointing. I just gotta stop whining and welcome myself to the 21st
  century living. :wink:

- I did manage to sort my thoughts to an extent and gain clarity on what's
  important to me and what's not. I'm surprised to realize that this is
  possible for me.

- I also wrote more. Not that I have a life as interesting as Tom Marvolo
  Riddle but I still blurted out a bunch of stuff in a
  diary/journal/whatever-the-fuck-you-call-it I maintain since a few months.

- Boring time! This was really crucial. Besides coming up with ideas to do
  certain things, I also felt more confident about myself due to the detox. I
  had some ideas and more importantly, I felt like I can take them to fruition!
  I'm yet to start working on any of them but hey isn't positive attitude nice
  shit to have on your side?

- I finally started reading [the
  book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43525780-the-vedas-and-upanishads-for-children)
  I was very excited to read when it released in early 2019. I read about 100
  pages. Quite slow than my usual pace but this is not some runaway fiction
  novel. It's a book that explains some of the most complex texts in easy to
  understand language.

### Okay, what else?

- I started spending less time on a commode because I wasn't mindlessly
  scrolling through Instagram feed while shitting.

- While I spent most mornings coughing the fuck out of me, I think mornings
  will become quieter if the cough dies away and I keep the data off during
  the first few hours of the day.

- It's Spring season in India. That means, it's more beautiful outside the
  house than inside (unless you're just married). The sky is more blue than
  usual. Or maybe the lack of blue light of smartphone has made the natural
  blue light look sexier to me!

- More books, more boredom, more writing. At least that's what I plan to
  continue with. I know I can't stay off the social media forever. In fact, I
  turned on the data this morning. But I don't feel the itch to keep checking
  my phone frequently.

- I have been staying away from mainstream media since over a year. But in the
  past week when tensions between India and Pakistan were high, I was watching a
  few news channels. And all the while I was feeling like turning it off
  already.

- I couldn't stop thinking of the asshole I had once become when I had issues
  with my ex-girlfriend (she's my wife now - I'm a one-woman man). And I missed
  that me real bad. I still do. That was a positive change in me during a
  crazy time.

### Parting thoughts (mostly crap)

I know you've got better things to do than reading the crap I write. 

Maybe it's just me (I know I'm getting old) but I don't really like the way
the advent of social media has changed the way we do some very basic yet
special things. For example, not a long time ago, we would call up someone on a
birthday; these days a "Happy Birthday" on WhatsApp/Facebook is all we do and
mostly we don't even mean it! I'd rather not wish that person instead of faking
a wish!

Or we would go to a cafe and have a talk without clicking tonnes of selfies or
mindlessly scrolling through the feeds and looking like two strangers just
sharing the same fucking table. Or we would actually savour the food at a
restaurant instead of clicking pics from different angles and eating the meal
while simultaneously checking the number of likes we got!

Maybe it's just me but relations feel more real outside the virtual world than
inside. When the distance is the barrier, it makes sense to use these platforms.
But being glued to the phone all the time has made me more depressed and
anxious than I ever thought was possible!

### That's it!

I'm done. I don't know why I wrote this post. I don't know if I did the right
thing by writing this here. I don't know if this detox was the right thing to
do or if I should have continued it for more than a week. Heck, I don't know
anything. But a week of self-imposed Instagram exile made me feel good about
myself. Better than I have felt in a long time.

And in this entire week, there was only one friend who pinged me a few times on
WhatsApp to know about my whereabouts and if I had blocked them or if I was
dead (too bad for you that I'm still alive). Guess I'm lucky to have one such
friend. It's scary how small the circle of people gets as we grow old. Or maybe
I'm being a wrong kind of an asshole in my life so far. :wink:

Until next time... :smile:
