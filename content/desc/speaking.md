Speaking is a series of posts that I have written to share my speaking
and organizing experience at conferences, meetups, universities. I started
speaking at meetups in November 2014 but never really wrote about it. With
time, I started getting opportunities to talk at various events and also mentor
number of university students in Linux and Python. I figured I'd start sharing
my experience on my blog! :smile:
