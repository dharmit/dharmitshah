I'm an engineering graduate from India. IITs are the best engineering
institutes in India. NITs follow the suite. Although some might want to debate,
that's not the point of this post. I pursued my engineering education from a
non-IIT and non-NIT institute. I think most engineering graduates in India have
dreamed of being in IIT/NIT and I'm no exception. Studying at IIT was my dream
as well but, it's not an easy feat to get into one.

So when I got an opportunity to speak at IIT Gandhinagar, I was obviously
excited. Topic was containers. And the expected audience was extremely
dispersed. I was expected to address under-grad, post-grad and doctarate
students from Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

Considering the vast audience, I decided to start from the beginning about how
containers evolved, how they compare with VMs, how Docker popularized them, how
Kubernetes took over the orchestration world and how containers have made a
lasting impact on the development and deployment story. I also discussed about
monoliths and microservices.

### The Talk

First, [the
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/91432605?rel=0):

{{< slideshare id="91432605" >}}

I started with a show of hands to know how many in the audience had heard of or
played with containers. Surprisiginly there were just about 2-3 people. Total
audience was around 25-30, I guess. So my decision to start from how it all
began proved to be right.

As I went ahead with the slides, I got some questions around the slide that
talked about Docker commands.

Although there weren't many questions around the rest of the slides, it did
seem like the topics mentioned in the slides were likely unheard of earlier by
the audience. 

At the end of the talk, one of the PhD students told me that she found my talk
interesting+informative but she's not much into the architecture stuff. At that
time, I was a bit confused about why she said so and didn't get a chance to
talk further. However, I don't think my talk was around computer architecture.
It did talk about the microservices pattern but due to lack of time, I didn't
dive deep into it.

### Informal discussions with faculties

I went to IIT Gandhinagar upon invitation from one of the faculty members. And
two more faculty members attended my talk. I got an opportunity to interact
with three faculties and the discussions were pretty interesting. Having talked
at few other colleges, I felt that, in general, challenges they face are pretty
much the same.

General opinion of the faculties was that most students weren't really aware of
much of the things happening in the world of containers. One of the surprising
discussion was around how students felt that it was more rewarding to work on
making web/mobile apps than working on Operating Systems, Networking, and
other things that keep you closer to the hardware. Having worked with people
doing both sort of things, I certainly feel like working on the latter is
rewarding as well. Sure the hype is around making next breakthrough (read
multi-million dollar) app but, the core things that make them possible are
seeing development as well!

We even planned on having a workshop to have hands-on about containers and
developing an app based on microservices pattern. Idea of using OpenShift to do
CI/CD, build images and eventually deploy the code seemed interesting to the
faculty members.

Above all, and probably the best part, the faculties were more than willing to
host community meetups at IIT Gandhinagar campus. I'm really looking forward to
hosting a meetup at IIT Gandhinagar in near future! I'm sure many engineers
would be excited to visit an IIT. :wink:

### Mistakes on my part

- I didn't manage to get a single picture of the talk.
- I forgot to bring any laptop stickers for the students.

### That's it

Being a non-IIT grad, it was surely an exciting experience to be speaking to
IIT students about the technologies that are changing the landscape. IIT
Gandhinagar's location is pretty amazing and far, far away from any sort of
pollution one can think of - hence my kind of place. :wink:

Until next time... :smile:
