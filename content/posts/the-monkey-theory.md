Recently I read [The Monkey Theory](https://amzn.to/2mRYrcL) by Sfurthi Sahare.
I read the book's blurb and felt like it's going to be about the things I've
read in other self-help books and blogs but with a different approach. And it
did turn out that way!

### What's the book about?

It's about the "monkeys" in our head. These monkeys are our various traits
and/or emotions. For example, *Procrastination Monkey* or *Fear Monkey*. It's about
how we live so much in our head that it often leads to things in real life. In
that sense, it's similar to the ideas presented in "The Power Of Your
Subconscious Mind" by Dr Joseph Murphy.

It talks about how, in spite of our best intentions and goals, we fail to
achieve what we have set out to. How various monkeys get in our way and ruin
things for us. How our inability to control our minds leads us to fall short
of our dreams.

How these monkeys, that prevent us from achieving our goals, end up making us
loathe ourselves and even bring down our self-worth, unbeknownst to us.

### What did I love about this book?

After finishing the book, I read a review about it that said that the book was
useless because it didn't present any new ideas and it was all same old wisdom.
I found that harsh.

In my humble opinion, the wisdom shared by age-old texts is simply presented
differently in modern books. Having read "The Gita for Children" and "The Vedas
and Upanishads for Children", I find modern wisdom to be the same points
presented in different language/manner. Most times, they present a
technique/method/process that sets them apart from old wisdom or other books on
modern wisdom.

This book seemed no different to me in that context. What I loved was the way
the author presented the ideas using "monkeys"! To me, that was an absolutely
new tyle and it helped me finish the book in a day. It was funny and
engrossing.

In the end, it also shares a simple technique to keep these "monkeys" at bay
and make sure that we can focus on what's actually important.

### That's it

I think this book is best suited for teenagers. Most teenagers I have met in my
family dislike reading and talking to them about any kind of
self-help/self-improvement books is like stepping into a territory full of
mines. But, I think, the style in this book is simple and funny enough to keep
these people engaged and maybe help them overcome the dislike/fear they have
for reading. :wink:
