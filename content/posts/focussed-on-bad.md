Yesterday, I sat out to write about the mistakes and learnings from my
professional career that I started after graduation, but ended up writing about
[mistakes and learnings from my college life](../college). That's why I find
the quote "Writing is thinking" to be 100% correct!

Among the various mistakes I made during college life, one mistake that I
couldn't think of while writing the post, but it later lit up in my head was
'focussing more on the bad instead of focussing on the good.' This mistake has
become a pattern in my life. It's been nearly twelve years since I graduated
(or as most Indians like to call it—“passed out"), but this habit of focussing
on the bad, what doesn't work, or what I don't like, instead of focussing on
the good, what works, and what I like, has created an overall critical mindset.
It's not that critical thinking has only been a negative influence. Instead, it
has helped me at a few places, like testing not just success but also failure
scenarios for the code I write.

In my first job out of the college, I was adamant about working on Linux. So
much so that I didn't touch the code part of the project that was in Java. It's
a different thing that I didn't like writing Java at all. I still worked there
for a year because 1) I had signed a bond and was too afraid to break it, and
2) I needed to accumulate money to be able to do Red Hat's RHCE certification
without asking my parents for money.

During this one year in [Nagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur), I was
laser focussed on the bad parts, like:
* City not being an IT hub unlike Pune, Bangalore, etc.
* The sucky part of working with a client where most of their team didn't want
  computers to replace the paperwork (it was a government organization)
* Lack of work related to Linux
* The crappy office politics

I almost missed enjoying or didn't see the good parts of the life then, like:
* Nagpur being a medium paced city instead of being fast-paced
* Less traffic and resulting ease of commute
* working in a team where almost all members were fresh out of the college and
  bachelors, and hence life was similar to what it was during hostel days
* The freedom to upskill myself since the Internet at the office was fast,
  unrestricted, and unmonitored.

Everything that I disliked about Nagpur the city has become immaterial in
hindsight, and I miss the city for its relaxed vibes, broad roads (big deal for
Indian cities), and negligible local language bias unlike cities like Pune,
Bengaluru, or Chennai.
