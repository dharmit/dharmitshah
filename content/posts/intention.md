This is not really my first attempt at blogging. I've tried and failed numerous
times so far. :smiley: This might or might not be another such attempt at
writing.

I enjoy hosting and talking at meetups. During one such recent meetup, I
volunteered to give a talk about technologies I had not played much with.

It was the result of challenging myself to prepare for this talk that I decided
to start writing - as a challenge. And as every other living creature, I hope
to succeed. :smile:

I intend to write about my learnings on various technologies that I play around
with. I hope it helps someone else out there some time. 

I don't think of myself as an expert at any of the technologies I intend to
write about; so if you have any comments/suggestions/feedback, please feel free
to ping me. :wink:
