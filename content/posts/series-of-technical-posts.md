When I decided to make some use of this domain, one (and probably most
important for me) thing that I had in mind was to write a series of
posts/articles on tech that I work on or that interests me. I had already
decided on using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) but was not sure how to group
articles in the form of a series.

That's when I came across [Nate Finch's](https://npf.io) website and read his
[post](https://npf.io/2014/08/making-it-a-series/) on how he managed to group
articles into a series. Knowing how greatly I suck at frontend, I decided to
clone his [repo](https://github.com/natefinch/npf) and modify things to suit my
requirements. I didn't want my discomfort with frontend get in the way of
writing!

In coming few days, I'll be writing a tech series, starting with
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). At the moment, I have not decided how many
posts I'll write or what specific topics I'll dive into or how frequently I'll
write. The only thing I've decided to do is *to write*.

Through writing, I want to share what I know (with the hope of being helpful to
someone some day) and learn from the feedback/suggestions of readers.
