I have had a pretty bad track record at learning new programming language by
myself, at consistently writing a blog, at continuing working on (or being
excited about) the side project I'm doing. That sounds like having a bad track
record at pretty much everything that matters in the world of open source and
programming. :disappointed:

It took me really long to learn Python. I remember starting from `print Hello
World` a number of times because it had been really long since I last wrote
anything in Python. I've been bad at coming up with side project ideas or
contributing to many open source projects. It wasn't until my job required me
to write Python full time that I started getting good at it. :smirk:

Same goes for Go. I have been willing to learn it since mid 2015.
Coincidentally, the job change I made around the time required me to learn Go
along the way. But I left that job too soon and moved back into the Python
world. I did contribute [little
something](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/pull/813) to a Go based
project that I like. And, secretly, I feel happy when every release
announcement of the project requires a mention about the command I contributed.
But that's pretty much it.

So what the heck am I gonna do now? Well, turns out I'm going to try yet
another time. :smile:

Recently I came across this tweet which resonated with me in opposite way of
how it was intended to. :wink::

We all have some spare time and I figured I could use some of it to write
something in Go.

So, I planned to do a tiny side project that's not going to be of much use to
anyone except me. But, it would help me learn Go - the growth I've wished to
make to my profile. This time, I'm going to try and blog as I make progress on
the project. That way, I might actually end up making a helpful contribution to
myself.

The project's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dharmit/hnot) and, at the
moment, has nothing but a short README of planned features.

Hope to take this to a closure. Best of luck to me! :wink:
