### The morning

Different people wake up at different times. Before I became a parent, I used
to wake up by 6:30 AM (sometimes earlier) and sleep by 11:00 PM (sometimes
earlier or later). But since becoming a parent, I sleep when my daughter
permits, and wake up when she commands. She's a little over two years old, so
my sleeping pattern is starting to get back into its place.

The part I love about waking up early is the chirping of birds, freshness in
the air, the cool atmosphere, and an overall peaceful environment. The chirping
of birds has to be my favourite part of the morning. I find mornings very
conducive for exercising, and do whatever I can to get my body moving. Earlier
I used to go to the gym, but that stopped since the onset of the pandemic and
later the birth of my daughter. Since past two months I go to learn swimming.
Anyway, I'm miles (light years?) away from my fitness goals.

When I was a kid, my grandpa instilled a phrase in my head - "Early to bed
early to rise" - and as far as I remember, he skipped the remainder of it which
says - "...makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise". I'm sure he thought the
former would naturally take care of the latter. During the high school and
higher secondary school (8th grade to 12th), I would wake up early to study
because my dad kept telling me that human mind is fresh in the morning and can
easily learn things compared to any other time of the day.

When we travelled, I would wake up early, usually a little after the dawn
breaks and before the sun rises, and love spending that time simply observing
the nature around the place. I have always wanted to know and feel how a place
looks, feels, smells, sounds like in early morning. Golden hours (time around
sunrise and sunset) also make for very picturesque, and sometimes dramatic,
photos.

### The murderers

India is a religious country to the point that I won't be surprised if most
number of religions are followed here. However, the invention of loudspeakers
made this a bit problematic. While I think of myself as a religious person, I
find it really annoying that the loudspeakers are used so extensively at
places of worship. A few even use a mix of a few musical instruments that
automatically start at a specific time every day (6:00AM or 6:30AM in my
neighbourhood). And it's not just one religious group making use of it; it's
almost all the religions, which I observe have a place of worship in my
vicinity, that make use of these systems.

Then there are people, usually senior citizens, in my neighbourhood who wake up
early to wake others forcibly. As I said earlier, before becoming a parent, I
used to comfortably wake up early, but not any more since I barely get to sleep
early. These old folks either start talking loudly with neighbours or turn on a
music system and play religious songs on it. Upon requesting them to reduce the
volume, they give a sermon about waking up early. Phew.

Another category of people are the Honkers - people who use the horn of their
bike/car as a piano to play the tune of a song playing in their
heads/headphones. I don't think it's a bad karma to wish ill for them,
especially if they honk during the wee hours.

Then there are stray dogs who love barking in the complete silence of the
night (usually between 12AM to 4AM). But one can't be mad at dogs when the
most evolved creatures (a.k.a. humans) are no good than an unevolved animals at
making loud noises in the name of worship, celebration, entertainment, and
whatnot!

### Noise pollution

As kids, we all studied about noise pollution and its adverse effects on mental
health, and hence physical health. However, as we grow old, we seem to become
dumber and do things that we were taught not to do as kids. Things like noise
pollution, light pollution, excessive screen time are, in my opinion, silent
pandemics that go unnoticed for a long time, or even forever, by most of us
but cause great levels of negative impact which, a lot of times, is difficult
or impossible to gauge. 

So much for being the most evolved species on the planet. :)
