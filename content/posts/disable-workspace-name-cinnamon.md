title = "Disable Workspace Name Notification in Cinnamon"
+++

I use Fedora with Cinnamon desktop environment. I use the workspaces feature heavily in that, my browser is on a dedicated namespace, IDE and terminal are on a dedicated namespace, and mail client on another.

When you switch between namespaces, Cinnamon shows the workspace name in the center of the screen as a notification which goes away in probably less than a second. This wasn't a problem till now. While switching between browser and IDE workspaces too often, this workspace name notification came in way and I had to wait before continuing doing anything on the workspace I switched to.

To disable this notification:
* Open `System Settings` from the Cinnamon start menu
* Select `Workspaces` from under `Preferences`
* Toggle the option `Enable workspace OSD`
